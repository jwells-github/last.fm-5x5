# last.fm-5x5
A [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) chart/collage generator based off the common 5x5 format. Built with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and the [Imagick extension](https://github.com/Imagick/imagick) for [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) 

The program requests a user's played music history from the Last.fm API and then outputs a shareable image representing the user's most played albums from a chosen time period
